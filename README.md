# Clouds-and-Rain
 A finished version of the weather sim.
 Went through and created a light storm on a mountain, which was a simple construction project. Played around with my ability to construct a scene that was more light and gentle like a light spring storm. The mountain and forest were made with assistance from the Standard Assets pack to help bring it to life more.
